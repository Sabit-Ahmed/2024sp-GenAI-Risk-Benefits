### Retrieval-Augmented Generation for AI-Generated Content: A Survey
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19473v1
+ The development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has been facilitated by advancements in model algorithms, scalable foundation model architectures, and the availability of ample high-quality datasets. While AIGC has achieved remarkable performance, it still faces challenges, such as the difficulty of maintaining up-to-date and long-tail knowledge, the risk of data leakage, and the high costs associated with training and inference. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a paradigm to address such challenges. In particular, RAG introduces the information retrieval process, which enhances AIGC results by retrieving relevant objects from available data stores, leading to greater accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing efforts that integrate RAG technique into AIGC scenarios. We first classify RAG foundations according to how the retriever augments the generator. We distill the fundamental abstractions of the augmentation methodologies for various retrievers and generators. This unified perspective encompasses all RAG scenarios, illuminating advancements and pivotal technologies that help with potential future progress. We also summarize additional enhancements methods for RAG, facilitating effective engineering and implementation of RAG systems. Then from another view, we survey on practical applications of RAG across different modalities and tasks, offering valuable references for researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, we introduce the benchmarks for RAG, discuss the limitations of current RAG systems, and suggest potential directions for future research. Project: this https URL


### Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10997
  + Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful capabilities, but they still face challenges in practical applications, such as hallucinations, slow knowledge updates, and lack of transparency in answers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refers to the retrieval of relevant information from external knowledge bases before answering questions with LLMs. RAG has been demonstrated to significantly enhance answer accuracy, reduce model hallucination, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks. By citing sources, users can verify the accuracy of answers and increase trust in model outputs. It also facilitates knowledge updates and the introduction of domain-specific knowledge. RAG effectively combines the parameterized knowledge of LLMs with non-parameterized external knowledge bases, making it one of the most important methods for implementing large language models. This paper outlines the development paradigms of RAG in the era of LLMs, summarizing three paradigms: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. It then provides a summary and organization of the three main components of RAG: retriever, generator, and augmentation methods, along with key technologies in each component. Furthermore, it discusses how to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG models, introducing two evaluation methods for RAG, emphasizing key metrics and abilities for evaluation, and presenting the latest automatic evaluation framework. Finally, potential future research directions are introduced from three aspects: vertical optimization, horizontal scalability, and the technical stack and ecosystem of RAG.

### A Comprehensive Study of Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models
+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01286
+ Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating text that closely mirrors human communication. However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.

+ Table reasoning, which aims to generate the corresponding answer to the question following the user requirement according to the provided table, and optionally a text description of the table, effectively improving the efficiency of obtaining information. Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the mainstream method for table reasoning, because it not only significantly reduces the annotation cost but also exceeds the performance of previous methods. However, existing research still lacks a summary of LLM-based table reasoning works. Due to the existing lack of research, questions about which techniques can improve table reasoning performance in the era of LLMs, why LLMs excel at table reasoning, and how to enhance table reasoning abilities in the future, remain largely unexplored. This gap significantly limits progress in research. To answer the above questions and advance table reasoning research with LLMs, we present this survey to analyze existing research, inspiring future work. In this paper, we analyze the mainstream techniques used to improve table reasoning performance in the LLM era, and the advantages of LLMs compared to pre-LLMs for solving table reasoning. We provide research directions from both the improvement of existing methods and the expansion of practical applications to inspire future research.
