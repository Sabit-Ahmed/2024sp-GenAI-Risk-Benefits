### Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering in Large Language Models: a comprehensive review
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14735
  + Banghao Chen, Zhaofeng Zhang, Nicolas Langren√©, Shengxin Zhu / This paper delves into the pivotal role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring input text for LLMs and is a technique integral to optimizing the efficacy of LLMs. This survey elucidates foundational principles of prompt engineering, such as role-prompting, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, as well as more advanced methodologies such as the chain-of-thought and tree-of-thoughts prompting. The paper sheds light on how external assistance in the form of plugins can assist in this task, and reduce machine hallucination by retrieving external knowledge. We subsequently delineate prospective directions in prompt engineering research, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of structures and the role of agents in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) tools. We discuss how to assess the efficacy of prompt methods from different perspectives and using different methods. Finally, we gather information about the application of prompt engineering in such fields as education and programming, showing its transformative potential. This comprehensive survey aims to serve as a friendly guide for anyone venturing through the big world of LLMs and prompt engineering.

### Skeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding
+ This work aims at decreasing the end-to-end generation latency of large language models (LLMs). One of the major causes of the high generation latency is the sequential decoding approach adopted by almost all state-of-the-art LLMs. In this work, motivated by the thinking and writing process of humans, we propose Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), which first guides LLMs to generate the skeleton of the answer, and then conducts parallel API calls or batched decoding to complete the contents of each skeleton point in parallel. Not only does SoT provide considerable speed-ups across 12 LLMs, but it can also potentially improve the answer quality on several question categories. SoT is an initial attempt at data-centric optimization for inference efficiency, and further underscores the potential of pushing LLMs to think more like a human for answer quality.

### Topologies of Reasoning: Demystifying Chains, Trees, and Graphs of Thoughts
+ The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models' (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and others parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.


# Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering in Large Language Models: a comprehensive review

### Introduction
Models that are built on Large Language Model (LLM) as the backbone are capable of extracting meaningful information that can assist medical diagnosis or creating engaging contents. These models are also referred to as Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). Once the AIGC model is trained, by changing the way we compose the prompts as input to the model, the quality of the model's output can change. In this paper, we focus on techniques of engineering the prompts to achieve higher quality model output from the same AIGC model.

### Basic of Prompt Engineering

One basic technique to improve the model output is to **be clear and precise** in writing the prompt, see an example from the below figure. When the prompt is vague, since there are numerous ways a model could respond, the model often ends up with a broad response that are less useful. Being more specific in the prompt can guide it towards the response that we are looking for. 

**Role-playing** is another basic technique that is effective in improving the model output. Prompting the model to role-play as an historian may improve the model's output when the question is related to a historical event. Prompting the model to role-play as an expert in AI may have a similar positive effect when the question is about LLM.

**Few Shot prompting** is also a common prompt engineering technique, where the model is given a few examples with answers in addition to the original question. This relies on the few shot learning ability that is emergent in large language models, which can be understood as a form of meta learning. 

Authors of the paper also note that **adjusting the temperature and top-p** is essential for prompt engineering. For code generation where standard pattern is valued, a smaller temperature and top-p is preferred, whereas in creative writing, a larger temperature and top-p may help the model produce original responses.

### Advanced Prompt Engineering 

Chain of Thought prompting induces the model to respond with step by step reasoning, which not only improves the quality of the output, but also shows correct intermediate steps for high stake applications such as medical reasoning. **Zero-shot chain of thought** is a simple yet effective technique, where we only need to include the phrase "Let's think step by step" to the input. **Golden chain of thought** is a technique that utilizes few-shot prompting for chain of thought prompting, by providing ground truth chain of thoughts solutions as examples to the input of the model. Golden chain of thoughts can boost the solve rate from 38% to 83% in the case of GPT-4, but the method is limited by the requirement of ground truth chain of thoughts examples. 

**Self-Consistency** is an extension to chain of thought prompting. After chain of thought prompting, by sampling from the language model decoder and choosing the most self-consistent response, Self-Consistency achieves better performance in rigorous reasoning tasks such as doing proofs.

**Knowledge Generation** breaks down the content generation into two step generations: in the first step generation, the model is only prompted to output pertinent information (knowledge) of the original query, then the knowledge is included as prompt in the second step generation. 

**Least-to-most prompting** also takes a multi-step generation approach similar to knowledge generation. A given problem is decomposed into numerous sub-problems, and the model will output responses for each sub-problem. These responses will be included in the prompt to help the model answer the original problem.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/unleash_prompt_engineering/4.png" width="100%" height="100%">

**Tree of Thoughts reasoning** constructs the steps of reasoning in a tree structure. This is particularly helpful when we need to break down a problem into steps, and further break down of each steps into more steps. **Graph of Thoughts** is a generalization of tree of thought structure, where each each contains the relation between each node. Graph of thoughts may be helpful for problems requiring intricate multifaceted resolutions. 


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/unleash_prompt_engineering/5.png" width="100%" height="100%">


**Chain of Verification** corrects a response that may contain false information, by prompting the LLM to ask verification questions for the response. LLM may correct the false information by answering the verification questions. These answers will help LLM to generate a more accurate response for the original query. 

In addition to the specific techniques mentioned above, there also exist **Plug-ins** of ChatGPT such as Prompt Enhancer that automatically enhance the prompt for the user.

### Accessing the Efficacy of Prompt Methods

Benchmarking the prompt methods requires evaluating the quality of response from LLM, which can be performed by human or by other metrics. 

**Subjective¬†evaluations** requires human evaluators, which has the advantage of evaluating¬†fluency, accuracy, novelty, and relevance, and some of its disadvantages are the inconsistency problem, expensive, and time consuming.

**Objective evaluations** relies on metrics to evaluate the response. Some examples includes BLEU, which is a biLingual evaluation and BERTScore, which relies on a BERT Model for the metric.

Objective evaluations has pros such as automatic evaluation, cheap, quick and cons particularly about the alignment problem.


Evaluation results from InstructEval shows that in few shot settings, once the examples are specified, providing additional prompt harms the performance, while in zero shot settings, the expert written prompt improves performance.

### Application of Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering can help **Assessment in teaching and learning**, where tailored prompts can set the pace for the student. Zero-shot prompting can generate elements such as settings, characters and outlines, allowing for **content creation and editing**. In the domain of **computer programming**, self-debugging prompting outperforms other text-to-SQL models and minimizes the number of attempts. Prompted engineering also significantly reduces error rate when applied to **reasoning tasks**. Finally, prompt engineering can also support **dataset generation**, where LLm can be prompted to generate smaller datasets for training domain specific models.

# Skeleton Of Thought:¬†Prompting LLMs For Efficient Parallel Generation
## Motivation
LLMs have powerful performance, but the inference speed is low due to :

- Large model size
- Expensive attention operation
- The sequential decoding approach

Existing work either compress/redesign the model,¬†serving system, hardware.

This work instead focus on **the 3rd axis** and propose **Skeleton Of Thought for efficient parallel decoding** without **any changes to LLM models, systems and hardwares.**

## High-level Overview

The idea comes from how humans answer questions. Steps of human thoughts can be summarized as below:
1.  Derive out the skeleton according to protocals and strategies.
2. Add evidence and details to explain each point.
If we visualize these steps, it looks like:
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/01_human_thoughts.png" width="50%" height="50%"></p>

Based on this, this paper proposed **Skeleton-of-Thought** as shown in Figure below which includes 3 steps:
1. Prompt the LLM to give out the skeleton.
2. Conduct batched decoding or parallel API calls to expand multiple points in parallel.
3. Aggregate the outputs to get final answer.
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/02_SoT.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

Compared with 12 recently released LLMs, SoT can not only provide considerable speed-ups but also improve the answer quality as shown in figure below. 

The y-axis `net win rate` is the difference between the fraction of questions that SoT-R has better and worse answers than normal generation.

The x-axis `speed-up` is the ratio between the latency of normal and SoT-R generation.

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/03_SoT_Comparison.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

## Method
The method of SoT has two stages: `skeleton stage` and `point-expanding stage`.

### Skeleton Stage
In skeleton stage, SoT uses a skeleton prompt to guide the LLM to output a concise skeleton of the answer so that we can extract some points from the skeleton response. A prompt example is shown in Figure below.
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/04_Skeleton_Prompt.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

### Point-expanding Stage
Based on the skeleton, SoT uses point-expanding prompt to let LLM expand on each point in parallel. A prompt example is shown in Figure below. After completing all points, SoT concatenate all the point-expanding responses to get the final answer.
<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/05_Point_Expanding_Prompt.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>


### Parallelization
The authors use parallel point expanding to achieve speed-up than normal decoding. In specific:
- For proprietary models with only API access, parallelization is achieved by issuing multiple API calls.
- For open-source models that we can run locally, parallelization is achieved by letting LLMs process point-expanding requests as a batch.

## Evaluation ‚Äì Overall Quality

For the evaluation, we can assess it from various perspectives.

- **Evaluation Process‚Äã:**

  - Present a question and a pair of answers to an LLM judge.

- **LLM-based evaluation frameworks:**

  - FastChat: general metric.

  - LLMZoo: general metric plus 5 detailed metrics - coherence, diversity, immersion, integrity, and relevance.

- **Extensions¬†to avoid evaluation bias:**

  - Running the evaluation twice with either ordering of the two answers

  - For each run, a score is assigned: 1 ‚Äì win;¬†0 ‚Äì tie; -1 ‚Äì lose

  - Sum the two scores to get the final score

- **Net win rates:**

  - (#win - #lose)/total number of questions

## Evaluation ‚Äì Evaluation of Answer Quality

- **Regarding Overall Quality, based on the figure provided, we can conclude:**

  - There is a discrepancy between the two metrics on win rates.

  - SoT is not worse than the baseline in around 60% of the cases.

  - The lose rates are also pretty high.

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/1.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

- **Regarding the quality of each model, the conclusions drawn from the figure indicate:**

  - The red rectangular frame in the figure highlights: Both metrics agree that OpenChat-13B, Vicuna-7B V1.1, Claude, LLaMA2-Chat-13B have **negative net win rates.**

  - The green rectangular frame in the figure highlights: Vicuna-13B V1.3, StableVicuna-13B, and UltraLM-13B have **positive net win rates.**

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/2.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

- **Based on the figure, the reasons for bad net win rates can be identified as follows:**

The question and answer provided by OpenChat-13B in the figure demonstrate that models construct the complete answer during the skeleton stage. And the figure showing the question and answer from Vicuna-7B V1.1 illustrates that models omit details during the point-expanding stage.

In summary, some strong models have very high-quality answers that are hard to beat.

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/3.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

- **Regarding the quality of each question category, our conclusions from the figure are:**

  - The green rectangular frame in the figure highlights: SoT performs relatively well on generic, common-sense, knowledge, and counterfactual questions.

  - The red rectangular frame in the figure highlights: Relatively¬†poorly¬†on¬†writing,¬†fermi,¬†math, and¬†coding.

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/4.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

- **Concerning the Quality of Detailed Metrics, the information from the figure reveals:**

  - SoT improves the diversity and relevance while hurting the immersion and coherence.

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/5.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

### SoT-R¬†‚Äì¬†Definition and Framework

- **Prompting Router:**

  - Ask¬†the LLM if the desired answer is in a list of independent points.

<p align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/S0-L20/images/Skeleton Of Thought/6.png" width="80%" height="80%"></p>

- **Trained Router:**

  - **Annotate** the LIMA training set: a label of 1 or 0.

  - **Fine-tune** a RoBERTa model using the labeled data.

  - Ask the RoBERTa¬†to **classify**¬†if the SoT is suitable for the desired answer.

## ‚ÄãSoT-R ‚Äì¬†Evaluation

Based on the provided figures, we can understand:

- SoT-R obtains **lower speed-ups** than SoT.

- SoT-R significantly **improves the answer quality** on questions where SoT is not suitable.

- The two types of SoT-R perform similarly to a human router.
